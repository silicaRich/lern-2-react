# lern2react

The purpose of this repo is to have some sort of simple to follow example of how react.js can be implemented.

## ~ Setup ~

#### Npm Modules Glossary
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) : Babel is a JavaScript transpiler that will transform your .JSX code into vanilla JavaScript (so that all browsers can interpret your next gen ES6 compliant code!)
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/): Webpack bundles your various Javascript files to create a new, transformed JavaScript file to be accessed by your browser.

#### Assumption:
You have npm installed. If not, install it here: https://nodejs.org/en/

### In your command prompt / terminal:

> npm install

> webpack

Then run/open you index.html
